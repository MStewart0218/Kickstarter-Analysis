# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
*Kickstarter data reflects a distribution Skewed- Right. Mean is higher than Median for Successful and Failed Goal amounts, as well as Sucessful Pledge amounts. Failed Pledge amount however, reflect a  symmetric distribution
*Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.Â
