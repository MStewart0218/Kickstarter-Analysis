# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview:

#### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Findings:

> * Kickstarter data reflects a distribution Skewed- Right. The Mean is higher than Median for Successful and Failed Goal amounts, as well as Sucessful Pledge amounts. Failed Pledge amount however, reflect a  symmetric distribution

> * Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 
> * Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. 
> * In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. 
> * In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.
